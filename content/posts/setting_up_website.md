I have dragged this for a long time now.

My kind of personal website is something which is very simple to both look at 
and also simple for me to maintain and write.

Although initially i used to think of trying out a new JavaScript framework and build my website with
that just as a way to try out a new framework when i was doing some frontend at work. But it's been so long since i did any frontend and i sort of lost interest in it.

I realised just plain old html, css and markdown is the way to go for a personal website which is
mostly just text, images and some code snippets, that's when i got to see a website which looks
mostly how i would like my website to be.

This was [Karan's website](https://mrkaran.dev) and i wanted to know the stack of his website, i knew
it was some [SSG](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/) (Static Site Generator), so i wanted to know which one was it and luckily Karan had a [blog post](https://mrkaran.dev/posts/migrating-to-zola/) about migrating his website to [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

After reading that blog post and taking a look at Zola documentation, i liked how simple it was,
just what i wanted. So i started building my website which is mostly(fine...., entirely) a copy of Karan's with minor changes.

### Deployment

The deployment is simple with Netlify, you can check out the steps [here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/netlify/).
Might feel fancy some day and deploy it on my own, but for now it does the job.
